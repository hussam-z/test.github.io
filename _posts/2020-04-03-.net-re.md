# Is It Really Easy To Reverse Engineering .NET Applications?

The answer is yes, when I was trying to get a spotify account, I found a program called **LordHamoSpotifyGenerator** and I opened it and found that it only opens using a pass code so I said why don't I try to do a reverse engineering for this program and get the pass code!

The first thing I did was check the program if it was using any encryption to protect it from theft using the DIE(Detect It Easy) program, I didn't find any protection to break it and this made the process even easier **lol**

Now we open the dnspy (**dnSpy** is a debugger and .NET assembly editor. You can use it to edit and debug assemblies even if you don't have any source code available) so we can see the source code **EZ BOY**

Now, when I checked the source code, I found 4 forms, each of them has a different job
